Create an image
At your command line or shell, in the app/app.py directory, build the image with the following command:
docker build -f app/Dockerfile -t sample-python:latest .



Running in Docker in local
Run the following command to have Docker run the application in a container and map it to port 5001:

docker run -p 5001:5000 sample-python:latest
Now navigate to http://localhost:5001, and you should see the â€œmessage"


Running in Kubernetes
As we have a web application,  will create a service and a deployment to run

kubectl apply -f k8/deployment.yaml

http://localhost:8081/
